    <h1>"A Little Bird" by Alexander Pushkin</h1>
    <p>In alien lands I keep the body <br>
    Of ancient native rites and things: <br>
    I gladly free a little birdie <br>
    At celebration of the spring. <br>
    <br>

    I'm now free for consolation, <br>
    And thankful to almighty Lord: <br>
    At least, to one of his creations <br>
    I've given freedom in this world! <br>
